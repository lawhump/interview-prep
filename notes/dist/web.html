significantly decrease load time on your page.
Typically, this is accomplished by:

<ul>
    <li>Combining scripts and stylesheets</li>
    <li>Using image sprites</li>
    <li>Avoiding redirects</li>
    <li>Avoiding frames</li>
</ul>
</dd><dt>Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network)</dt><dd>A CDN is a network of servers in different geographical
locations which all have access to the same files. 
Because proximity to server affects overall load time,
CDNs make it such that the best server is used in serving
files. Sometimes CDNs can be pricey, but there are several
that offer their services for free.
</dd><dt>CSS & JS files at the top & bottom respectively</dt><dd>Most notable browsers, except Opera, won't begin rendering
content until all of the stylesheets are downloaded and parsed.
Accordingly, it makes most sense to put them as early as possible.
<br>
JS files, however, should be placed as close to the closing body
tag as possible. Because JS files can potentially change any content
on the page, browsers will block downloads until the JS files are
downloaded and parsed. Also an argument for concatenating JS files.
</dd><dt>Concatenate stylesheets and scripts</dt><dd>Done to reduce the number of HTTP requests. Despite situational
instances where it's advantageous to have more than one stylesheet
or JS file, you can often get away with just using one.
</dd><dt>Minify HTML, CSS, and JS files</dt><dd>Also known as obfuscating, removing all of the whitespace in your
files is a simple way to decrease download size.
</dd><dt>Gzip components</dt><dd>A well performing page should serve its HTML, CSS, JS, and 
any other text files compressed. If your server responds with
a JSON object, this can be compressed as well. Most modern browsers
support Gzipped files.
</dd><dt>Host assets on different domains</dt><dd>Because browsers restrict the number of concurrent downloads per 
domain, you should split your assets between different domains.
Here is the data for current browsers' concurrent downloads.

mention it here. In AngularJS, often ng-cloak should work. In typical
web pages though, the best solution is put all of your CSS in the head.
This puts the styles before the content, so when the content finally loads,
it will be styled. <br>You could also set your body to visibility: hidden; and using javascript
display your body. Scripts execute well after content has displayed, hereby
avoiding FOUC.</p><h3><strong>What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?</strong></h3><p>"The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing standard works by adding new HTTP headers 
that allow servers to describe the set of origins that are permitted to read 
that information using a web browser.  Additionally, for HTTP request methods 
that can cause side-effects on user data (in particular, for HTTP methods other 
than GET, or for POST usage with certain MIME types), the specification mandates 
that browsers "preflight" the request, soliciting supported methods from the 
server with an HTTP OPTIONS request method, and then, upon "approval" from the 
server, sending the actual request with the actual HTTP request method.  Servers 
can also notify clients whether "credentials" (including Cookies and HTTP 
Authentication data) should be sent with requests."

I love <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7695044/what-does-doctype-html-do">this StackOverflow explanation.</a></p><h3><strong>What's the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?</strong></h3><p>Not as much of an immediate concern anymore, but a history lesson.
Way back when, the web was written in two versions: Netscape Navigator,
and Microsoft Internet Explorer. When web standards were created, browsers
could not immediately switch to the new standards, in fear of breaking most
existing sites.<br>Now there technically exists three modes: quirks mode, which emulates the 
Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer 5 experience, almost standards mode
has trace amounts of quirky behavior, and standards mode, and full standards
mode, whose behavior is compliant with HTML and CSS specifications.<br>"In HTML5, the only purpose of the DOCTYPE is to activate full standards mode. 
Older versions of the HTML standard gave additional meaning to the DOCTYPE, 
but no browser has ever used the DOCTYPE for anything other than switching 
between quirks mode and standards mode." [<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode">citation</a>]</p><h3><strong>What's the difference between HTML and XHTML?</strong></h3><p>It determines rules for parsing. Documents served with a 'Content-type: text/html'
header are to be parsed using HTML syntax rules, which are typically less strict, 
whereas a 'Content-type: application/xml+xhtml' header should be parsed using 
XHTML syntax which is more strict. <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/differences-html-xhtml/">More info can be read here.</a></p><h3><strong>Are there any problems with serving pages as application/xhtml+xml?</strong></h3><p>From Google HTML/CSS Standards:
"Use HTML5. HTML5 (HTML syntax) is preferred for all HTML documents: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. 
(It's recommended to use HTML, as text/html. Do not use XHTML. XHTML, as application/xhtml+xml, 
lacks both browser and infrastructure support and offers less room for optimization than HTML.)
Although fine with HTML, do not close void elements, i.e. write &lt;br&gt;, not &lt;br /&gt;."</p><h3><strong>How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?</strong></h3><p>Localization and Internationalization</p><h3><strong>Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?</strong></h3><p>HTML5 offers some more sematic text markup, e.g. article, aside, header, footer, input, etc., 
some of it's largest features come in the realm of multimedia, i.e. canvas and video. There is
also new data storage: local storage, session storage, and web database, as opposed to cookies.<br><em>Local storage </em>stores data with no expiration date.<br><em>Session storage </em>only stores data for one session.<br><em>Cookies </em>have far less space reserved. <br>This StackOverflow thread has a good explanation.<br><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220660/local-storage-vs-cookies">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220660/local-storage-vs-cookies</a></p><h3><strong>Describe the difference between &lt;script&gt;, &lt;script async&gt; and &lt;script defer&gt; .</strong></h3><p>David Walsh said it best: "This WebKit blog post explains the difference between defer and async best:<br><p class="blockquote">'Both async and defer scripts begin to download immediately without pausing the parser and both support 
an optional onload handler to address the common need to perform initialization which depends on the 
script. The difference between async and defer centers around when the script is executed. Each async 
script executes at the first opportunity after it is finished downloading and before the window's load 
event. This means it's possible (and likely) that async scripts are not executed in the order in which 
they occur in the page. The defer scripts, on the other hand, are guaranteed to be executed in the order 
they occur in the page. That execution starts after parsing is completely finished, but before the 
document's DOMContentLoaded event.'"</p></p><h3><strong>Have you used different HTML templating languages before?</strong></h3><p>Yo dude, I'm doing that right now! :D</p></article></article></section></body></html>
