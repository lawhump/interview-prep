# interview-prep
Conquering coding interviews by heaps and bounds.

Notes that I've taken as I've gone along are in templates/index.html

Coding questions are Cracking the Coding Interview, Edition 4.
They are located in /cracking-the-coding-challenge and are organized by topic
and question number.

Also, I don't know if this is the best way to do this, so feel free to contact me with any concerns! 

Best of luck, and may your code always compile on the first try!
