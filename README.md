# interview-prep
Conquering coding interviews by heaps and bounds.

Coding questions are Cracking the Coding Interview, Edition 4.
They are located in /cracking-the-coding-challenge and are organized by topic
and question number. 

For each question, I include a specification for the question and a picture of my thought process. Some questions I include the solution in code.

Also, I don't know if this is the best way to do this, so feel free to contact me with any concerns! 

Best of luck, and may your code always compile on the first try!

Alternatively, you can click the "Quickly jump between files" button and search whichever file extension you want to see code for (e.g. .java, .py, .js, etc.). I don't want to have to link these forever. :)
