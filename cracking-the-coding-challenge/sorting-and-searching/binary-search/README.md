# Trees

This has pretty much just become me playing around with trees. 

Because I started with BSTs, and wanted to relearn AVL trees, I figured I'd do a clean refactor and make it pretty object oriented. 

The parent class is an n-ary tree, which implements the Trees interface. From the n-ary tree, the binary tree is derived, and from that, the binary search tree. 

I plan to make Trees a package after I learn all core concepts and write all necessary methods, as to clean up this and future directories. I don't want to have to reinvent the wheel everytime I want to do a tree problem. Also, I'll learn about how to make packages along the way, and learning is always fun, ya know.
