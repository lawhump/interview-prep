# Trees

This has pretty much just become me playing around with trees. 

Because I started with BSTs, and wanted to relearn AVL trees, I figured I'd do a clean refactor and make it pretty object oriented. 

The parent class is an n-ary tree, which implements the Trees interface. From the n-ary tree, the binary tree is derived, and from that, the binary search tree.
