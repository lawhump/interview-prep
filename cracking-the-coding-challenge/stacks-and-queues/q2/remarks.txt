So I realized I made a large misinterpretation that significantly complicated the problem.

I haven't solved it yet. :( I have O(1) pop() and min(), and O(n) push.

I'm thinking using an array somehow for push() so I can have amortized constant time.

Not in the spirit of interviews to not solve it in one sitting, but I'm going to solve this problem.
